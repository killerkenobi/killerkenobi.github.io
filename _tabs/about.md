He focuses on technologies like Kubernetes and Docker. Recently, Anthony has taken an interest in blogging in an effort to help others overcome hurdles he encouters during his workday. This blog website is very much a work in progress :)

Anthony works closely with development, operations, and other security teams to integrate security measures into the DevOps pipeline, enabling continuous security testing and monitoring. This involves implementing security controls, automating security testing, and providing feedback on security risks and compliance issues.
