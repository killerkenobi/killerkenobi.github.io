Welcome to The Commit Log, a space where I explore the intricate worlds of software engineering, cybersecurity, and other technology-focused topics. This repository hosts both the content and the minimalist code that powers my website.

## About The Content Of This Blog
I use this blog to document my thoughts, share learnings, and dive deep into various technical concepts. The articles here are a reflection of my personal and professional interests.

### Topics You'll Find Here:
- **Software Development:** Best practices, architectural patterns, programming languages, and tool-smithing.
- **Cybersecurity:** Defensive and offensive security principles, threat analysis, and secure coding practices.
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Musings on cloud infrastructure, automation, and the culture that glues it all together.
- **General Technology:** Broader explorations of new tools, industry trends, and anything else that catches my interest.

## About This Website
This website was built with simplicity in mind. It's powered by a single [index.html](/index.html) file that dynamically loads and renders markdown articles directly from the articles folder in this repository. The entire site is hosted for free using GitHub Pages.
There are no complex frameworks, databases, or build stepsâ€”just pure, simple content delivery.

Feel free to browse the articles, and I hope you find something useful or interesting!
